# Key Takeaways

-Lots of Hidden Gems titles focus on analysis, data, and exploratory
data analysis (eda), which is not a huge shock! Other frequently used
words include visualisation, world, learning, science, and time.  
-Most titles (89%) did not include a question, in line with the
predominance of exploratory data analysis that would not lend itself to
a specific focus in such a form  
-Reviews contain many mentions of data and visuals, with notebook and
kaggle also featuring high up the list. Next on the list are detailed,
survey, and analysis.  
-The most featured Author in Hidden Gems is jonathonbouchet with 9
reviews, followed by thedatabeast (5 reviews). Next on the list are lots
of Authors with 3 reviews, with an honourable mention to captcalculator
for an amazing kaggle username.
