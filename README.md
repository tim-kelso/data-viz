# Data visualisation
Repo for weekly data visualisation projects, currently in R with datasets identified by rfordatascience/tidytuesday

I give myself an hour or so to create a meaningful visualisation or two.
I add notes on key takeaways and potential next steps, including improvements to the graph/s.

Rendered reports are available as .md files in their respective folders
