# tidyTuesday
Repo for weekly data visualisation projects in R from rfordatascience/tidytuesday

I give myself an hour to create a meaningful visualisation from the week's data.
I add notes on key takeaways and potential next steps, including improvements to the graph/s.

Rendered reports are available as .md files in the r_docs folder
