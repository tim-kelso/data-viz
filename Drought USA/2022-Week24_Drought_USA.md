# Background

## Data source

Data from National Integrated Drought Information System
(<https://www.drought.gov/>).

## Data information

*drought.csv* The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index to
characterize meteorological drought on a range of timescales, ranging
from 1 to 72 months, for the lower 48 U.S. states. The SPI is the number
of standard deviations that observed cumulative precipitation deviates
from the climatological average. NOAAâ€™s National Centers for
Environmental Information produce the 9-month SPI values below on a
monthly basis, going back to 1895. **(From
<https://www.drought.gov/historical-information?dataset=1&selectedDateUSDM=20110301&selectedDateSpi=19580901>)**

*drought_fips.csv* The Drought Severity and Coverage Index is an
experimental method for converting drought levels from the U.S. Drought
Monitor map to a single value for an area. DSCI values are part of the
U.S. Drought Monitor data tables. Possible values of the DSCI are from 0
to 500. Zero means that none of the area is abnormally dry or in
drought, and 500 means that all of the area is in D4, exceptional
drought.

FIPS id: first two digits = state, last 3 digits = county

# Analysis

## Initial thoughts

-   What state has endured the most/least drought since 2000?  
-   Map of average DSCI for each state (heatmap) from 2000 - 2022
-   Map of average DSCI for each county (heatmap) from 2000 - 2022
-   Scatterplot/violin/density/raincloud plot of average DSCI by month
    (all counties/states)
-   Using additional census data, in which state/county have the most
    people been affected by drought?

## Tables/Columns of potential interest:

-   FIPS: separate into state (first two digits) and county (last three
    digits)  
-   DSCI: measure of drought severity in an area

## Graphs

### Examining drought using a monthly average of DSCI

I will begin by examining how different states experience drought across
the year, using data from 2000 to 2022:

### Examining drought using an annualised average of DSCI  
This approach will demonstrate a broad yearly trend.

Here, I look at drought severity in the US as a whole,

and drought severity by State here:

# Key Takeaways

-   Drought intensity varies greatly by state and year
-   California has experienced some of the most intense droughts since
    2000  
-   In some years, drought is widespread. In other years, it is more
    localised.
-   The average annual drought intensity across the US was highest in
    2012 and lowest in 2019

# Possible next steps

-   Examine/visualise data at monthly average drought intensity rather
    than current annual average
-   Integration of population data - where are the most people affected
    by drought?
